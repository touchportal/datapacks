## Versioning System
Just because I can, I developed a versioning system with apis and multi-datapack features. It will be released as a template package soon, and all my datapacks will be ported to this new system. [The flowchart on how it works can be found here.](https://bubbl.us/11133984)

### Features:
- Standardised naming and structural system no matter what kind of pack you're developing
- Detect and deploy a custom version of your datapack targeted for that version of Minecraft
- Automatically cancel datapack installation on versions that are not supported
- Detect and install your datapack unless a newer version exists
- Run cleanup code to remove deprecated items, tags, and entities for old versions of your datapack
- Enable extra features if two datapacks are installed together (uninstalling one pack will simply disable the extra features)
- Cleanly uninstall and disable your pack with a simple function (<namespace>:uninstall)
